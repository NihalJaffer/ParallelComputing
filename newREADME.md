## Question 1: Automated Maze Explorer

This section presents a comprehensive explanation of how the automated maze explorer functions in the *maze-runner* project. It delves into the core algorithm, loop-handling mechanisms, backtracking strategy, and the performance metrics collected during execution. The explanation is grounded in both practical observations and code-level insights from `explorer.py`.

---

### 1. Algorithm Used: Right-Hand Rule

The automated explorer employs the **Right-Hand Rule**, a well-known technique for solving simply-connected mazes (i.e., those without internal loops). The explorer keeps its "right hand" in contact with the wall to systematically navigate the maze. At each step, the movement decision follows this priority order:

1. Turn right  
2. Move forward  
3. Turn left  
4. Turn around (backtrack)

This ensures that all paths are eventually explored and that the explorer does not overlook any corridor.

**Implementation Highlights:**

- In `explorer.py`, the agent maintains a current orientation (`current_direction`) and evaluates possible directions relative to this.
- The direction-based evaluation allows consistent movement logic across different positions within the maze.

---

### 2. Loop Detection Mechanism

To address the issue of cycles or revisiting paths, the explorer incorporates a basic but effective loop detection system:

- It tracks the history of visited cells using tuples of `(position, direction)`.
- If the agent revisits the same cell from the same direction multiple times in a short period, it's flagged as a potential loop.
- A dictionary (`visit_count`) logs the frequency of each visit per direction.

**Key Logic:**

```python
visit_count[(x, y, direction)] += 1
if visit_count[(x, y, direction)] > threshold:
    handle_loop()
```

This prevents the explorer from getting stuck in cycles and ensures steady progress toward unexplored regions.

---

### 3. Backtracking Strategy

The explorer initiates backtracking in two scenarios:

- When it hits a dead end, or  
- When it detects a loop

The strategy is reminiscent of **depth-first search (DFS)**, where:

- A stack (`path_history`) stores previously visited positions.
- The agent pops from the stack to return to earlier decision points.
- From those positions, it resumes exploring any unvisited directions.

This fallback mechanism ensures complete traversal even in complex or cyclic maze structures and helps the agent escape local traps efficiently.

---

### 4. Performance Metrics Collected

Upon completing its run, the explorer outputs a range of statistics to assess its performance:

| **Metric**              | **Description**                                                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Total Moves             | The number of steps taken from start to finish                    |
| Time Taken              | Total time (in seconds) for the entire exploration                |
| Backtracks              | Number of times the agent reversed direction due to obstacles     |
| Loop Encounters         | Count of loop detections and subsequent handling                  |
| Path History            | Sequence of `(x, y)` positions visited                            |
| Exploration Outcome     | Whether the goal was reached and the agent‚Äôs final position       |

These metrics are particularly useful for comparing behavior across different maze types or explorer configurations.

---

### 5. Observations Across Maze Types

**‚û§ Static Maze (Predefined Walls):**  
- The agent closely follows the right-hand wall.  
- Navigation is predictable with minimal backtracking.  
- Efficient traversal in linear or tree-like paths.  

**‚û§ Random Maze (Contains Cycles):**  
- The explorer occasionally revisits positions.  
- Loop detection and backtracking are triggered more often.  
- These mechanisms are crucial for eventual convergence.  

**‚û§ With Visualization:**  
- Real-time movement helps observe turns, reversals, and strategies.  
- Ideal for debugging and understanding decision-making.  

**‚û§ Without Visualization:**  
- Execution is significantly faster.  
- More suitable for large-scale performance testing.  
- Same core logic, but operates headlessly for efficiency.  

---

### Summary

The automated maze explorer showcases a robust and adaptable maze-solving approach. It effectively integrates:

- **Right-Hand Rule** navigation for systematic pathfinding  
- **Loop detection** to identify and escape cycles  
- **Backtracking** for dead-end recovery  
- **Comprehensive metrics** to evaluate performance  

These elements make the explorer well-suited for tackling both simple and complex maze environments.

## Question 2: Parallel Maze Exploration (30 points)

### Implementation Approaches

To enable parallel execution of maze explorers, I implemented two distinct parallelization strategies: one using Python‚Äôs `multiprocessing` module, and another using `MPI4Py` for distributed processing across multiple machines.

---

### 1. Multiprocessing Implementation (20 points)

This approach leverages Python‚Äôs built-in `multiprocessing` library to execute multiple explorers concurrently on a **single machine**.

**Key Implementation Steps:**

- Defined a `run_explorer()` function to execute a single maze explorer with a given random seed.
- Created `run_multiple_explorers()` using `multiprocessing.Pool` to distribute multiple explorer runs across available CPU cores.
- Implemented `display_results()` to collect and compare statistics from all runs and identify the most efficient explorer.

**Outcome:**

- Successfully ran **10 explorers simultaneously** on a static maze using all CPU cores.
- Collected performance metrics such as time taken, backtracks, and final positions.
- Enabled real-time comparison and visualization of results.

---

### 2. MPI4Py Implementation (30 points)

For distributed execution, I implemented an advanced solution using `MPI4Py`, enabling parallelism **across multiple machines** in a cluster setup.

**Key Components:**

- Designed a **master-worker architecture**:
  - The **master node** handled task distribution.
  - **Worker nodes** (including my VM `10.102.1.97` and teammate‚Äôs VM `10.102.1.87`) performed the actual exploration tasks.
- Each machine was assigned a fixed number of tasks (e.g., **25 explorers per machine**).

**Implementation Highlights:**

- Utilized **MPI collective communication**:
  - `broadcast()` for sending configuration data to all workers.
  - `gather()` to collect results back at the master.
- Ensured **load balancing** across nodes to prevent resource underutilization.
- Developed a **task reporting system** showing:
  - Which machine ran which tasks
  - Task outcomes and explorer stats per node

**Hostfile Sample:**
```
10.102.1.97 slots=4
10.102.1.87 slots=4
```

---

### Summary of Achievements

Both implementations satisfy the parallelization objectives:

- ‚úÖ **Parallel Execution**: Enabled simultaneous runs of multiple explorers  
- ‚úÖ **Statistical Collection**: Captured key metrics like total moves, time taken, backtracks, and loop encounters  
- ‚úÖ **Result Comparison**: Analyzed and identified the top-performing explorer  
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: Demonstrated performance benefits on both single and multi-machine setups

**Additional Features:**

- All results were saved to **JSON files** for further visualization and analysis using external tools or dashboards.

---

### Final Outcome

The parallel exploration system effectively supports batch testing, statistical comparison, and scalability for maze-solving tasks, making it a robust solution for evaluating algorithm performance under varying conditions.


## Question 3: Performance Analysis (10 points)

### Performance Metrics Analysis

The results from running multiple explorers on the **static maze** revealed key insights into the performance characteristics of the system:

---

### 1. Move Count

- All explorers completed the maze with exactly **1,279 moves**, regardless of their assigned random seeds.
- This indicates that the **Right-Hand Rule** algorithm yields a consistent path for the given static maze structure.

---

### 2. Backtracking

- **0 backtracks** were reported across all runs.
- This suggests that the maze does not contain dead ends or cyclic traps requiring reversal, confirming it is relatively straightforward.

---

### 3. Execution Time

Despite identical move counts, execution times varied noticeably:

| **Approach**          | **Time Range**                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Multiprocessing       | 0.0013 ‚Äì 0.0087 seconds        |
| MPI (Multi-Machine)   | As low as ~0.001 seconds       |

This variation highlights **non-algorithmic** factors influencing runtime.

---

### 4. Processing Speed

The number of moves processed per second varied significantly:

- Some explorers achieved **>1.2 million moves/second**
- Others performed at only **~250,000 moves/second**

This 4‚Äì5x discrepancy, despite identical algorithms and input, underscores the impact of **system-level factors** such as:

- CPU scheduling
- Memory access timing
- Cache utilization
- Background OS processes

---

### Key Observations

#### ‚úÖ Algorithm Consistency

- The Right-Hand Rule delivers consistent path lengths across all runs.
- Algorithmic behavior remained stable across multiprocessing and distributed runs.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Variability

- The variation in execution time is not due to the algorithm but to system-level resource contention.
- This indicates that **microbenchmarks of small tasks** may not benefit significantly from parallelization, especially across distributed nodes.

#### üöÄ Scalability

- The **MPI implementation** successfully ran **50 explorers** across two machines in about **0.22 seconds**.
- This demonstrates the potential for scalable distribution across nodes.

#### üß™ Speedup Limitations

- A reported speedup factor of **~0.25x** reveals the overhead of distributing small tasks can **outweigh performance gains** for lightweight problems.
- This suggests that **task granularity** is a key consideration for parallel scalability.

---

### Final Takeaway

While all explorers followed the same path (same move count, no backtracking), their execution performance varied due to **system-level runtime dynamics** rather than any algorithmic inefficiency.

These results suggest that more meaningful differences may emerge when:

- Using **larger or more complex mazes**
- Testing **different exploration strategies**
- Measuring **solution quality** in addition to execution speed

This analysis helps inform future optimization decisions and supports the value of designing scalable, task-appropriate parallelism strategies.


## Question 4: Enhanced Maze Explorer Implementation (20 points)

### 1. Identified Limitations of the Current Explorer

After analyzing the original maze explorer that relies on the **Right-Hand Rule**, several critical limitations were identified:

- **Inefficient Path Finding**: The explorer took **1,279 moves** on the static maze, revealing that the wall-following strategy is not optimized for path length.
- **Lack of Global Awareness**: The agent only sees its immediate surroundings. It does not account for the maze layout or the goal's location, leading to inefficient decision-making.
- **Fixed Exploration Strategy**: The algorithm is deterministic and does not adapt to the maze‚Äôs structure, resulting in redundant exploration.
- **No Path Optimization**: There is no mechanism to find or favor shorter paths.
- **Poor Performance in Structured Mazes**: While it guarantees reaching the goal, the path taken is often needlessly long in mazes with structured paths.

---

### 2. Proposed Improvements to the Exploration Algorithm

To overcome these limitations, I implemented two intelligent pathfinding algorithms:

#### A. **A* Search Algorithm**

- A heuristic-based algorithm that combines:
  - `g-score`: Cost to reach the current node
  - `h-score`: Estimated cost to reach the goal
- Prioritizes paths likely to reach the goal faster and more efficiently.

#### B. **Bidirectional Search**

- Simultaneously explores from the **start and goal** positions.
- The search ends when the two frontiers meet.
- Particularly efficient, as it reduces the search depth by half and greatly cuts down exploration time.

---

### 3. Implementation Details

#### A* Search

Implemented as the `AStarExplorer` class:

- Uses a **priority queue** to select the most promising node.
- Employs **Manhattan distance** as the heuristic.
- Tracks optimal paths to each visited node.

```python
def heuristic(self, pos: Tuple[int, int]) -> int:
    """Manhattan distance heuristic to estimate distance to goal."""
    x1, y1 = pos
    x2, y2 = self.maze.end_pos
    return abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)
```

#### Bidirectional Search

Implemented in the `BidirectionalExplorer` class:

- Runs two **breadth-first searches** from start and goal.
- Stops when both searches intersect.
- Reconstructs the full path by combining both partial paths.

```python
# Process node from forward direction
if self.forward_queue:
    current = self.forward_queue.popleft()

    # Check for intersection with backward search
    if current in self.backward_visited:
        self.moves = self.reconstruct_path(current)
```

---

### 4. Performance Results

| **Algorithm**         | **Moves** | **Time (s)** | **Moves/second** |
|-----------------------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Right-Hand Rule       | 1,279     | 0.0017       | 756,951          |
| A* Search             | 127       | 0.0022       | 56,916           |
| Bidirectional Search  | 127       | 0.0008       | 162,600          |

#### Key Findings:

- **Path Length Reduction**: Both A* and Bidirectional searches reduced the move count by **90.1%**.
- **Execution Time**:
  - A* was slightly slower than Right-Hand Rule due to higher computation, but required far fewer moves.
  - Bidirectional Search was **53% faster** than the original approach while also being optimal in path length.
- **Efficiency Insight**:
  - Though Right-Hand Rule had the highest "moves per second", most of those moves were inefficient.
  - Improved algorithms found significantly **shorter and more strategic paths**.

---

### 5. Analysis of Trade-offs

#### **A* Search**

‚úÖ Guarantees shortest path  
‚úÖ Works with any maze layout  
‚ùå Higher memory usage  
‚ùå Slightly slower execution  

#### **Bidirectional Search**

‚úÖ Fastest execution time  
‚úÖ Finds optimal or near-optimal paths  
‚úÖ Great for mazes with known start/end  
‚ùå Complex implementation  
‚ùå Less effective in highly obstructed mazes  

---

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

The new algorithms effectively resolve the limitations of the Right-Hand Rule:

- **Path reduced by 90%** (from 1,279 to 127 moves)
- **Global awareness** introduced via goal-oriented heuristics
- **Adaptive exploration** strategies replace fixed traversal
- **Optimized navigation** via shortest path computation
- **Improved efficiency**, especially with Bidirectional Search

Among the tested strategies, **Bidirectional Search** stands out as the most **effective and efficient**‚Äîoffering the shortest path in the least amount of time.

These results demonstrate how integrating intelligent algorithms like A* and Bidirectional Search can drastically improve maze-solving performance and scalability.


## Question 5: Performance Comparison of Enhanced Explorers (20 points)

### 1. Performance Comparison Results

To evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced explorers, I conducted comparative tests on the **static maze** using three different algorithms:

- ‚úÖ Right-Hand Rule (Original)
- ‚úÖ A* Search
- ‚úÖ Bidirectional Search

#### Key Performance Metrics:

| **Algorithm**         | **Moves** | **Time (s)** | **Backtracks** | **Moves/second** |
|-----------------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Right-Hand Rule       | 1,279     | 0.0017       | 0              | 756,951          |
| A* Search             | 127       | 0.0022       | 0              | 56,916           |
| Bidirectional Search  | 127       | 0.0008       | 0              | 162,600          |

---

### üìè Path Length Analysis

- Both **A*** and **Bidirectional Search** reduced the path length by **90.1%** ‚Äî from **1,279 moves** to just **127**.
- This is a **10√ó improvement** in solution quality.
- Both enhanced explorers successfully found the **optimal path**.

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time Efficiency Analysis

- **A*** Search was **~30% slower** than Right-Hand Rule (0.0022s vs 0.0017s).
- **Bidirectional Search** was **53% faster** than Right-Hand Rule (0.0008s vs 0.0017s).
- Despite being optimal in path quality, **Bidirectional Search was also the fastest** algorithm.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Processing Rate Analysis

| **Metric**               | **Observation**                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Right-Hand Rule          | Highest moves/sec but mostly redundant moves                   |
| A* Search                | Lower moves/sec but highly optimized and meaningful             |
| Bidirectional Search     | Balanced high efficiency and optimal result                     |

Right-Hand Rule‚Äôs higher processing speed is misleading due to its **inefficient pathfinding**.

---

### 2. üìä Visualization of Improvements

---

#### üìå General Trade-offs of Enhanced Algorithms

| **Aspect**              | **Right-Hand Rule**     | **A* Search**            | **Bidirectional Search**     |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Path Quality            | Poor (10√ó longer)        | Optimal                   | Optimal                       |
| Speed                   | High                     | Moderate                  | Fastest                       |
| Memory Usage            | Low                      | Moderate                  | Moderate to High              |
| Implementation Effort   | Low                      | Medium                    | High                          |
| Scalability             | Poor                     | Good                      | Excellent                     |

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Conclusion

The enhanced explorers **vastly outperformed** the original algorithm:

- üî• **Path Quality**: 90% path reduction with both A* and Bidirectional Search  
- üöÄ **Time Efficiency**: Bidirectional was faster than the original while finding a better path  
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Overall Efficiency**: Bidirectional Search is the **clear winner**‚Äîoptimal path with fastest execution
